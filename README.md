# 🏆 2023 College Wrestling Championship Finalists - Data Analysis Project

This is a fully customized data analysis project where I explored and visualized data from the 2023 College Wrestling Championship Finalists. The project demonstrates my capabilities in data collection, data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and storytelling using Excel and data visualization tools.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze patterns and trends among the 2023 college wrestling finalists. I collected the raw data manually and deliberately introduced inconsistencies to simulate real-world data cleaning scenarios. The final analysis provides insights into performance trends, regional strengths, and team-wise comparisons.

## 💡 Key Highlights

- ✅ **Raw Data Collection**: Personally gathered data from official sources to ensure authenticity.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Simulated errors (duplicates, inconsistencies, missing data) to showcase cleaning skills using Excel formulas and features like Find & Replace, Data Validation, and Filters.
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Leveraged Pivot Tables to extract meaningful insights.
- 📈 **Visualizations**: Created charts and dashboards to present key takeaways clearly.
